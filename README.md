# WEBSERVER EXPLOIT

This repository contains the exploit code for [webserver program] (whose source code can be found [here]). This exploit takes advantage of the stack overflow vulnerability caused by no bound checking on user input in 'recieve_line()' present in [send_recieve.h] which causes corruption of connection_handler()'s stack frame leading to arbitrary code execution. The shellcode used can be found in the [shellcode] directory.

## USAGE
Issue the commands bellow on the terminal (while present in the project directory) to get the directory to the local system-

```shell
critical@d3ad:~$ git clone https://github.com/compilepeace/WEBSERVER_EXPLOIT.git
Cloning into 'WEBSERVER_EXPLOIT'...

remote: Total 34 (delta 11), reused 30 (delta 7), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (34/34), done.

critical@d3ad:~$ cd ./WEBSERVER_EXPLOIT/webserver

critical@d3ad:~WEBSERVER_EXPLOIT/webserver$ make
gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack web_server.c -o webserver

```

To reproduce exploitation -
